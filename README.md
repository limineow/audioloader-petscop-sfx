hi, if you're reading this, you're probably either poking around in the files or trying to install this locally in the case this doesn't get accepted to deckthemes or you prefer local installations.

to install it locally on deck, drop the PetscopSFX folder from releases into /home/deck/homebrew/sounds
if you're not on deck, god help you
